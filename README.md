## **Echo-Sort-Arduino Repository**

Welcome to the **Echo-Sort** repository. This repository contains the code and configurations for the hardware integration aspect of the Echosort project. It focuses on enabling robotic automation using the trained machine learning model for trash sorting.

#### **Project Overview**
Echosort is a Data Science project aimed at improving the global recycling industry. This repository supports the deployment of the trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on an Arduino-based server to control a robotic arm for trash sorting tasks.

#### **Features**
1. **Hardware Integration:** Code to interface the Arduino system with the robotic arm.
2. **Model Deployment:** Mechanisms for integrating the trained model to classify objects in real time.
3. **Automation Workflow:** Scripts to handle trash classification results and translate them into arm movements for sorting.
4. **Scalability:** Modular and configurable design for adapting to various recycling scenarios.

#### **Usage**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BenBashi/Echo-Sort-Arduino.git
   ```
2. Follow the hardware setup guide in `hardware_setup.md` to configure the Arduino and robotic arm.
3. Use the provided scripts to deploy the trained model and start the automation process.

#### **Future Enhancements**
- Integration with additional sensors for enhanced object detection.
- Real-time feedback mechanisms to improve sorting accuracy.
- Support for other hardware platforms to expand system capabilities.
